# Interviewee-Questions
Questions that you could ask HR/interviewer to help you make decision before joining.

At the time of joining, the HR/interviewer portrays the company like it is match made in Heaven, but sometimes reality is far from it. I have had my experiences, atleast you should be aware of what you are getting into. Ask these questions to find potential red flags 🚩 before making a decision.
